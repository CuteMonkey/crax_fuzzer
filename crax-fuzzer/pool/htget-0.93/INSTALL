To install htget:
-----------------

run "make" to compile the binary

then run "make install" as root to install the man page and binary.

Next, copy the htgetrc file to your home directory as .htgetrc to
install htget's default configuration. Running "cp htgetrc ~/.htgetrc" 
will do this in most shells including bash.


Finally, test it out. You could try running htget as shown below:

htget http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~jwhitham/htget/htget.lsm

This should get a file, htget.lsm, which will be the LSM entry of
the latest version of htget, direct from my website!
(of course, my webserver isn't the most reliable..)


htget should compile and run on any Linux system, but has only been
tested with Linux 2.x.x. No libraries other than libc are required.

The man page is installed in /usr/man/man1.
The binary is installed in /usr/bin.
