.SH DESCRIPTION
Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of Cambridge.
It is a large program with very many facilities. For a full specification, see
the reference manual. This man page contains only a description of the command
line options. It has been automatically generated from the reference manual
source, which is why the formatting is poor in some places.

.SH SETTING OPTIONS BY PROGRAM NAME
.TP 10
\fBmailq\fR
Behave as if the option \-bp were present before any other options. The \-bp
option requests a listing of the contents of the mail queue on the standard
output.
.TP
\fBrsmtp\fR
Behaves as if the option \-bS were present before any other options, for
compatibility with Smail. The \-bS option is used for reading in a number of
messages in batched SMTP format.
.TP
\fBrmail\fR
Behave as if the \-i and \-oee options were present before any other options,
for compatibility with Smail. The name \fBrmail\fR is used as an interface by
some UUCP systems. The \-i option specifies that a dot on a line by itself
does not terminate a non\-SMTP message; \-oee requests that errors detected in
non\-SMTP messages be reported by emailing the sender.
.TP
\fBrunq\fR
Behave as if the option \-q were present before any other options, for
compatibility with Smail. The \-q option causes a single queue runner process
to be started. It processes the queue once, then exits.
.TP
\fBnewaliases\fR
Behave as if the option \-bi were present before any other options, for
compatibility with Sendmail. This option is used for rebuilding Sendmail's
alias file. Exim does not have the concept of a single alias file, but can be
configured to run a specified command if called with the \-bi option.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
\fB\-\-\fR
This is a pseudo\-option whose only purpose is to terminate the options and
therefore to cause subsequent command line items to be treated as arguments
rather than options, even if they begin with hyphens.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
This option causes Exim to output a few sentences stating what it is.
The same output is generated if the Exim binary is called with no options and
no arguments.
.TP
\fB\-B <type>\fR
This is a Sendmail option for selecting 7 or 8 bit processing. Exim is 8\-bit
clean; it ignores this option.
.TP
\fB\-bd\fR
This option runs Exim as a daemon, awaiting incoming SMTP connections. Usually
the \-bd option is combined with the \-q<time> option, to specify that
the daemon should also initiate periodic queue runs.

The \-bd option can be used only by an admin user. If either of the \-d
(debugging) or \-v (verifying) options are set, the daemon does not
disconnect from the controlling terminal. When running this way, it can be
stopped by pressing ctrl\-C.

By default, Exim listens for incoming connections to the standard SMTP port on
all the host's running interfaces. However, it is possible to listen on other
ports, on multiple ports, and only on specific interfaces.

When a listening daemon is started without the use of \-oX (that is, without
overriding the normal configuration), it writes its process id to a file called
exim\-daemon.pid in Exim's spool directory. This location can be overridden
by setting PID_FILE_PATH in Local/Makefile. The file is written while
Exim is still running as root.

When \-oX is used on the command line to start a listening daemon, the
process id is not written to the normal pid file path. However, \-oP can be
used to specify a path on the command line if a pid file is required.

The SIGHUP signal can be used to cause the daemon to re\-exec itself. This
should be done whenever Exim's configuration file, or any file that is
incorporated into it by means of the ".include" facility, is changed, and also
whenever a new version of Exim is installed. It is not necessary to do this
when other files that are referenced from the configuration (for example, alias
files) are changed, because these are reread each time they are used.
.TP
\fB\-bdf\fR
This option has the same effect as \-bd except that it never disconnects from
the controlling terminal, even when no debugging is specified.
.TP
\fB\-be\fR
Run Exim in expansion testing mode. Exim discards its root privilege, to
prevent ordinary users from using this mode to read otherwise inaccessible
files. If no arguments are given, Exim runs interactively, prompting for lines
of data. Long expressions can be split over several lines by using backslash
continuations.
As in Exim's run time configuration, whitespace at the start of continuation
lines is ignored.

Each argument or data line is passed through the string expansion mechanism,
and the result is output. Variable values from the configuration file (for
example, $qualify_domain) are available, but no message\-specific values
(such as $domain) are set, because no message is being processed.
.TP
\fB\-bF  <filename>\fR
This option is the same as \-bf except that it assumes that the filter being
tested is a system filter. The additional commands that are available only in
system filters are recognized.
.TP
\fB\-bf  <filename>\fR
This option runs Exim in filter testing mode; the file is the filter file to be
tested, and a test message must be supplied on the standard input. If there are
no message\-dependent tests in the filter, an empty file can be supplied. If a
system filter file is being tested, \-bF should be used instead of \-bf. If
the test file does not begin with
one of the special lines

  # Exim filter
  # Sieve filter

it is taken to be a normal .forward file, and is tested for validity under
that interpretation.

The result of an Exim command that uses \-bf, provided no errors are
detected, is a list of the actions that Exim would try to take if presented
with the message for real. More details of filter testing are given in the
separate document entitled Exim's interfaces to mail filtering.

When testing a filter file, the envelope sender can be set by the \-f option,
or by a `From ' line at the start of the test message. Various parameters that
would normally be taken from the envelope recipient address of the message can
be set by means of additional command line options. These are:

  \-bfd  <domain>             default is the qualify domain
  \-bfl  <local_part>         default is the logged in user
  \-bfp  <local_part_prefix>  default is null
  \-bfs  <local_part_suffix>  default is null

The local part should always be set to the incoming address with any prefix or
suffix stripped, because that is how it appears to the filter when a message is
actually being delivered.
.TP
\fB\-bh  <IP address>\fR
This option runs a fake SMTP session as if from the given IP address, using the
standard input and output. The IP address may include a port number at the end,
after a full stop. For example:

  exim \-bh 10.9.8.7.1234
  exim \-bh fe80::a00:20ff:fe86:a061.5678

Comments as to what is going on are written to the standard error file. These
include lines beginning with `LOG' for anything that would have been logged.
This facility is provided for testing configuration options for incoming
messages, to make sure they implement the required policy. For example, you can
test your relay controls using \-bh.

Warning 1: You cannot test features of the configuration that rely on
ident (RFC 1413) callouts. These cannot be done when testing using
\-bh because there is no incoming SMTP connection.

Warning 2: Address verification callouts are
also skipped when testing using \-bh. If you want these callouts to occur,
use \-bhc instead.

Messages supplied during the testing session are discarded, and nothing is
written to any of the real log files. There may be pauses when DNS (and other)
lookups are taking place, and of course these may time out. The \-oMi option
can be used to specify a specific IP interface and port if this is important.

The exim_checkaccess utility is a `packaged' version of \-bh whose
output just states whether a given recipient address from a given host is
acceptable or not.
.TP
\fB\-bhc  <IP address>\fR
This option operates in the same way as \-bh, except that address
verification callouts are performed if required. This includes consulting and
updating the callout cache database.
.TP
\fB\-bi\fR
Sendmail interprets the \-bi option as a request to rebuild its alias file.
Exim does not have the concept of a single alias file, and so it cannot mimic
this behaviour. However, calls to /usr/lib/sendmail with the \-bi option
tend to appear in various scripts such as NIS make files, so the option must be
recognized.

If \-bi is encountered, the command specified by the "bi_command"
configuration option is run, under the uid and gid of the caller of Exim. If
the \-oA option is used, its value is passed to the command as an argument.
The command set by "bi_command" may not contain arguments. The command can use
the exim_dbmbuild utility, or some other means, to rebuild alias files if
this is required. If the "bi_command" option is not set, calling Exim with
\-bi is a no\-op.
.TP
\fB\-bm\fR
This option runs an Exim receiving process that accepts an incoming,
locally\-generated message on the current input. The recipients are given as the
command arguments (except when \-t is also present \-\- see below). Each
argument can be a comma\-separated list of RFC 2822 addresses. This is the
default option for selecting the overall action of an Exim call; it is assumed
if no other conflicting option is present.

If any addresses in the message are unqualified (have no domain), they are
qualified by the values of the "qualify_domain" or "qualify_recipient"
options, as appropriate. The \-bnq option (see below) provides a way of
suppressing this for special cases.

Policy checks on the contents of local messages can be enforced by means of the
non\-SMTP ACL.
The return code is zero if the message is successfully accepted. Otherwise, the
action is controlled by the \-oex option setting \-\- see below.

The format of the message must be as defined in RFC 2822, except that, for
compatibility with Sendmail and Smail, a line in one of the forms

  From sender Fri Jan  5 12:55 GMT 1997
  From sender Fri, 5 Jan 97 12:55:01

(with the weekday optional, and possibly with additional text after the date)
is permitted to appear at the start of the message. There appears to be no
authoritative specification of the format of this line. Exim recognizes it by
matching against the regular expression defined by the "uucp_from_pattern"
option, which can be changed if necessary.
The specified sender is treated as if it were given as the argument to the
\-f option, but if a \-f option is also present, its argument is used in
preference to the address taken from the message. The caller of Exim must be a
trusted user for the sender of a message to be set in this way.
.TP
\fB\-bnq\fR
By default, Exim automatically qualifies unqualified addresses (those
without domains) that appear in messages that are submitted locally (that
is, not over TCP/IP). This qualification applies both to addresses in
envelopes, and addresses in header lines. Sender addresses are qualified using
"qualify_domain", and recipient addresses using "qualify_recipient" (which
defaults to the value of "qualify_domain").

Sometimes, qualification is not wanted. For example, if \-bS (batch SMTP) is
being used to re\-submit messages that originally came from remote hosts after
content scanning, you probably do not want to qualify unqualified addresses in
header lines. (Such lines will be present only if you have not enabled a header
syntax check in the appropriate ACL.)

The \-bnq option suppresses all qualification of unqualified addresses in
messages that originate on the local host. When this is used, unqualified
addresses in the envelope provoke errors (causing message rejection) and
unqualified addresses in header lines are left alone.
.TP
\fB\-bP\fR
If this option is given with no arguments, it causes the values of all Exim's
main configuration options to be written to the standard output. The values
of one or more specific options can be requested by giving their names as
arguments, for example:

  exim \-bP qualify_domain hold_domains

However, any option setting that is preceded by the word `hide' in the
configuration file is not shown in full, except to an admin user. For other
users, the output is as in this example:

  mysql_servers = <value not displayable>

If "configure_file" is given as an argument, the name of the run time
configuration file is output.
If a list of configuration files was supplied, the value that is output here
is the name of the file that was actually used.

If "log_file_path" or "pid_file_path" are given, the names of the
directories where log files and daemon pid files are written are output,
respectively. If these values are unset, log files are written in a
sub\-directory of the spool directory called "log", and the pid file is written
directly into the spool directory.

If \-bP is followed by a name preceded by +, for example,

  exim \-bP +local_domains

it searches for a matching named list of any type (domain, host, address, or
local part) and outputs what it finds.

If one of the words "router", "transport", or "authenticator" is given,
followed by the name of an appropriate driver instance, the option settings for
that driver are output. For example:

  exim \-bP transport local_delivery

The generic driver options are output first, followed by the driver's private
options. A list of the names of drivers of a particular type can be obtained by
using one of the words "router_list", "transport_list", or
"authenticator_list", and a complete list of all drivers with their option
settings can be obtained by using "routers", "transports", or "authenticators".
.TP
\fB\-bp\fR
This option requests a listing of the contents of the mail queue on the
standard output. If the \-bp option is followed by a list of message ids,
just those messages are listed. By default, this option can be used only by an
admin user. However, the "queue_list_requires_admin" option can be set false
to allow any user to see the queue.

Each message on the queue is displayed as in the following example:

  25m  2.9K 0t5C6f\-0000c8\-00 <alice@wonderland.fict.example>
            red.king@looking\-glass.fict.example
            <other addresses>

The first line contains the length of time the message has been on the queue
(in this case 25 minutes), the size of the message (2.9K), the unique local
identifier for the message, and the message sender, as contained in the
envelope. For bounce messages, the sender address is empty, and appears as
`<>'. If the message was submitted locally by an untrusted user who overrode
the default sender address, the user's login name is shown in parentheses
before the sender address.
If the message is frozen (attempts to deliver it are suspended) then the text
`*** frozen ***' is displayed at the end of this line.

The recipients of the message (taken from the envelope, not the headers) are
displayed on subsequent lines. Those addresses to which the message has already
been delivered are marked with the letter D. If an original address gets
expanded into several addresses via an alias or forward file, the original is
displayed with a D only when deliveries for all of its child addresses are
complete.
.TP
\fB\-bpa\fR
This option operates like \-bp, but in addition it shows delivered addresses
that were generated from the original top level address(es) in each message by
alias or forwarding operations. These addresses are flagged with `+D' instead
of just `D'.
.TP
\fB\-bpc\fR
This option counts the number of messages on the queue, and writes the total
to the standard output. It is restricted to admin users, unless
"queue_list_requires_admin" is set false.
.TP
\fB\-bpr\fR
This option operates like \-bp, but the output is not sorted into
chronological order of message arrival. This can speed it up when there are
lots of messages on the queue, and is particularly useful if the output is
going to be post\-processed in a way that doesn't need the sorting.
.TP
\fB\-bpra\fR
This option is a combination of \-bpr and \-bpa.
.TP
\fB\-bpru\fR
This option is a combination of \-bpr and \-bpu.
.TP
\fB\-bpu\fR
This option operates like \-bp but shows only undelivered top\-level addresses
for each message displayed. Addresses generated by aliasing or forwarding are
not shown, unless the message was deferred after processing by a router with
the "one_time" option set.
.TP
\fB\-brt\fR
This option is for testing retry rules, and it must be followed by up to three
arguments. It causes Exim to look for a retry rule that matches the values
and to write it to the standard output. For example:

  exim \-brt bach.comp.mus.example
  Retry rule: *.comp.mus.example  F,2h,15m; F,4d,30m;

The first
argument, which is required, can be a complete address in the form
local_part@domain, or it can be just a domain name. The second argument is
an optional second domain name; if no retry rule is found for the first
argument, the second is tried. This ties in with Exim's behaviour when looking
for retry rules for remote hosts \-\- if no rule is found that matches the host,
one that matches the mail domain is sought. The final argument is the name of a
specific delivery error, as used in setting up retry rules, for example
`quota_3d'.
.TP
\fB\-brw\fR
This option is for testing address rewriting rules, and it must be followed by
a single argument, consisting of either a local part without a domain, or a
complete address with a fully qualified domain. Exim outputs how this address
would be rewritten for each possible place it might appear.
.TP
\fB\-bS\fR
This option is used for batched SMTP input, which is an alternative interface
for non\-interactive local message submission. A number of messages can be
submitted in a single run. However, despite its name, this is not really SMTP
input. Exim reads each message's envelope from SMTP commands on the standard
input, but generates no responses. If the caller is trusted, or
"untrusted_set_sender" is set, the senders in the SMTP MAIL commands are
believed; otherwise the sender is always the caller of Exim.

The message itself is read from the standard input, in SMTP format (leading
dots doubled), terminated by a line containing just a single dot. An error is
provoked if the terminating dot is missing. A further message may then follow.

As for other local message submissions, the contents of incoming batch SMTP
messages can be checked using the non\-SMTP ACL.
Unqualified addresses are automatically qualified using "qualify_domain" and
"qualify_recipient", as appropriate, unless the \-bnq option is used.

Some other SMTP commands are recognized in the input. HELO and EHLO act
as RSET; VRFY, EXPN, ETRN, and HELP act as NOOP;
QUIT quits, ignoring the rest of the standard input.

If any error is encountered, reports are written to the standard output and
error streams, and Exim gives up immediately.
The return code is 0 if no error was detected; it is 1 if one or more messages
were accepted before the error was detected; otherwise it is 2.

.TP
\fB\-bs\fR
This option causes Exim to accept one or more messages by reading SMTP commands
on the standard input, and producing SMTP replies on the standard output. SMTP
policy controls, as defined in ACLs are applied.

Some user agents use this interface as a way of passing locally\-generated
messages to the MTA.
In this usage, if the caller of Exim is trusted, or "untrusted_set_sender" is
set, the senders of messages are taken from the SMTP MAIL commands.
Otherwise the content of these commands is ignored and the sender is set up as
the calling user. Unqualified addresses are automatically qualified using
"qualify_domain" and "qualify_recipient", as appropriate, unless the \-bnq
option is used.

The \-bs option is also used to run Exim from inetd, as an alternative to
using a listening daemon. Exim can distinguish the two cases by checking
whether the standard input is a TCP/IP socket. When Exim is called from
inetd, the source of the mail is assumed to be remote, and the comments
above concerning senders and qualification do not apply. In this situation,
Exim behaves in exactly the same way as it does when receiving a message via
the listening daemon.
.TP
\fB\-bt\fR
This option runs Exim in address testing mode, in which each argument is taken
as an address to be tested for deliverability. The results are written to the
standard output.
If a test fails, and the caller is not an admin user, no details of the
failure are output, because these might contain sensitive information such as
usernames and passwords for database lookups.

If no arguments are given, Exim runs in an interactive manner, prompting with a
right angle bracket for addresses to be tested. Each address is handled as if
it were the recipient address of a message (compare the \-bv option). It is
passed to the routers and the result is written to the standard output.
However, any router that has "no_address_test" set is bypassed. This can
make \-bt easier to use for genuine routing tests if your first router passes
everything to a scanner program.

The return code is 2 if any address failed outright; it is 1 if no address
failed outright but at least one could not be resolved for some reason. Return
code 0 is given only when all addresses succeed.

Warning: \-bt can only do relatively simple testing. If any of the
routers in the configuration makes any tests on the sender address of a
message,
you can use the \-f option to set an appropriate sender when running
\-bt tests. Without it, the sender is assumed to be the calling user at the
default qualifying domain. However, if you have set up (for example) routers
whose behaviour depends on the contents of an incoming message, you cannot test
those conditions using \-bt. The \-N option provides a possible way of
doing such tests.
.TP
\fB\-bV\fR
This option causes Exim to write the current version number, compilation
number, and compilation date of the exim binary to the standard output.
It also lists the DBM library this is being used, the optional modules (such as
specific lookup types), the drivers that are included in the binary, and the
name of the run time configuration file that is in use.
.TP
\fB\-bv\fR
This option runs Exim in address verification mode, in which each argument is
taken as an address to be verified. During normal operation, verification
happens mostly as a consequence processing a "verify" condition in an ACL. If you want to test an entire ACL, see the \-bh option.

If verification fails, and the caller is not an admin user, no details of the
failure are output, because these might contain sensitive information such as
usernames and passwords for database lookups.

If no arguments are given, Exim runs in an interactive manner, prompting with a
right angle bracket for addresses to be verified. Verification differs from
address testing (the \-bt option) in that routers that have "no_verify" set
are skipped, and if the address is accepted by a router that has "fail_verify"
set, verification fails. The address is verified as a recipient if \-bv is
used; to test verification for a sender address, \-bvs should be used.

If the \-v option is not set, the output consists of a single line for each
address, stating whether it was verified or not, and giving a reason in the
latter case. Otherwise, more details are given of how the address has been
handled, and in the case of address redirection, all the generated addresses
are also considered. Without \-v, generating more than one address by
redirection causes verification to end sucessfully.

The return code is 2 if any address failed outright; it is 1 if no address
failed outright but at least one could not be resolved for some reason. Return
code 0 is given only when all addresses succeed.

If any of the routers in the configuration makes any tests on the sender
address of a message, you should use the \-f option to set an appropriate
sender when running \-bv tests. Without it, the sender is assumed to be the
calling user at the default qualifying domain.
.TP
\fB\-bvs\fR
This option acts like \-bv, but verifies the address as a sender rather
than a recipient address. This affects any rewriting and qualification that
might happen.
.TP
\fB\-C  <filelist>\fR
This option causes Exim to find the run time configuration file from the given
list instead of from the list specified by the CONFIGURE_FILE
compile\-time setting. Usually, the list will consist of just a single file
name, but it can be a colon\-separated list of names. In this case, the first
file that exists is used. Failure to open an existing file stops Exim from
proceeding any further along the list, and an error is generated.

When this option is used by a caller other than root or the Exim user,
and the list is different from the compiled\-in list, Exim gives up
its root privilege immediately, and runs with the real and effective uid and
gid set to those of the caller.
However, if ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY is defined in Local/Makefile, root
privilege is retained for \-C only if the caller of Exim is root.
This option is not set by default.

Setting ALT_CONFIG_ROOT_ONLY locks out the possibility of testing a
configuration using \-C right through message reception and delivery, even if
the caller is root. The reception works, but by that time, Exim is running as
the Exim user, so when it re\-execs to regain privilege for the delivery, the
use of \-C causes privilege to be lost. However, root can test reception and
delivery using two separate commands (one to put a message on the queue, using
\-odq, and another to do the delivery, using \-M).

If ALT_CONFIG_PREFIX is defined in Local/Makefile, it specifies a
prefix string with which any file named in a \-C command line option
must start. In addition, the file name must not contain the sequence /../.
However, if the value of the \-C option is identical to the value of
CONFIGURE_FILE in Local/Makefile, Exim ignores \-C and proceeds as
usual. There is no default setting for ALT_CONFIG_PREFIX; when it is
unset, any file name can be used with \-C.

ALT_CONFIG_PREFIX can be used to confine alternative configuration files
to a directory to which only root has access. This prevents someone who has
broken into the Exim account from running a privileged Exim with an arbitrary
configuration file.

The \-C facility is useful for ensuring that configuration files are
syntactically correct, but cannot be used for test deliveries, unless the
caller is privileged, or unless it is an exotic configuration that does not
require privilege. No check is made on the owner or group of the files
specified by this option.
.TP
\fB\-D <macro>=<value>\fR
This option can be used to override macro definitions in the configuration file. However, like \-C, if it is used by an
unprivileged caller, it causes Exim to give up its root privilege.
If DISABLE_D_OPTION is defined in Local/Makefile, the use of \-D is
completely disabled, and its use causes an immediate error exit.

The entire option (including equals sign if present) must all be within one
command line item. \-D can be used to set the value of a macro to the empty
string, in which case the equals sign is optional. These two commands are
synonymous:

  exim \-DABC  ...
  exim \-DABC= ...

To include spaces in a macro definition item, quotes must be used. If you use
quotes, spaces are permitted around the macro name and the equals sign. For
example:

  exim '\-D ABC = something' ...

\-D may be repeated up to 10 times on a command line.
.TP
\fB\-d <debug options>\fR
This option causes debugging information to be written to the standard
error stream. It is restricted to admin users because debugging output may show
database queries that contain password information. Also, the details of users'
filter files should be protected. When \-d is used, \-v is assumed. If
\-d is given on its own, a lot of standard debugging data is output. This can
be reduced, or increased to include some more rarely needed information, by
following \-d with a string made up of names preceded by plus or minus
characters. These add or remove sets of debugging data, respectively. For
example, \-d+filter adds filter debugging, whereas \-d\-all+filter selects
only filter debugging. The available debugging categories are:

  acl            ACL interpretation
  auth           authenticators
  deliver        general delivery logic
  dns            DNS lookups (see also resolver)
  dnsbl          DNS black list (aka RBL) code
  exec           arguments for "execv()" calls
  expand         detailed debugging for string expansions
  filter         filter handling
  hints_lookup   hints data lookups
  host_lookup    all types of name\-to\-IP address handling
  ident          ident lookup
  interface      lists of local interfaces
  lists          matching things in lists
  load           system load checks
  local_scan     can be used by local_scan()
  lookup         general lookup code and all lookups
  memory         memory handling
  pid            add pid to debug output lines
  process_info   setting info for the process log
  queue_run      queue runs
  receive        general message reception logic
  resolver       turn on the DNS resolver's debugging output
  retry          retry handling
  rewrite        address rewriting
  route          address routing
  timestamp      add timestamp to debug output lines
  tls            TLS logic
  transport      transports
  uid            changes of uid/gid and looking up uid/gid
  verify         address verification logic

  all            all of the above, and also \-v

The resolver option produces output only if the DNS resolver was compiled
with DEBUG enabled. This is not the case in some operating systems. Also,
unfortunately, debugging output from the DNS resolver is written to stdout
rather than stderr.

The default (\-d with no argument) omits expand, filter,
interface, load, memory, pid, resolver, and timestamp.
However, the pid selector is forced when debugging is turned on for a
daemon, which then passes it on to any re\-executed Exims. Exim also
automatically adds the pid to debug lines when several remote deliveries are
run in parallel.

The timestamp selector causes the current time to be inserted at the start
of all debug output lines. This can be useful when trying to track down delays
in processing.

If the "debug_print" option is set in any driver, it produces output whenever
any debugging is selected, or if \-v is used.
.TP
\fB\-dropcr\fR
This is an obsolete option that is now a no\-op. It used to affect the way Exim
handled CR and LF characters in incoming messages.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR
This option specifies that an incoming message is a locally\-generated delivery
failure report. It is used internally by Exim when handling delivery failures
and is not intended for external use. Its only effect is to stop Exim
generating certain messages to the postmaster, as otherwise message cascades
could occur in some situations. As part of the same option, a message id may
follow the characters \-E. If it does, the log entry for the receipt of the
new message contains the id, following `R=', as a cross\-reference.
.TP
\fB\-ex\fR
There are a number of Sendmail options starting with \-oe which seem to be
called by various programs without the leading "o" in the option. For example,
the "vacation" program uses \-eq. Exim treats all options of the form
\-ex as synonymous with the corresponding \-oex options.
.TP
\fB\-F  <string>\fR
This option sets the sender's full name for use when a locally\-generated
message is being accepted. In the absence of this option, the user's gecos
entry from the password data is used. As users are generally permitted to alter
their gecos entries, no security considerations are involved. White space
between \-F and the <string> is optional.
.TP
\fB\-f  <address>\fR
This option sets the address of the envelope sender of a locally\-generated
message (also known as the return path). The option can normally be used only
by a trusted user, but "untrusted_set_sender" can be set to allow untrusted
users to use it. In the absence of \-f, or if the caller is not allowed to
use it, the sender of a local message is set to the caller's login name at the
default qualify domain.

There is one exception to the restriction on the use of \-f: an empty sender
can be specified by any user, to create a message that can never provoke a
bounce. An empty sender can be specified either as an empty string, or as a
pair of angle brackets with nothing between them, as in these examples of shell
commands:

  exim \-f '<>' user@domain
  exim \-f "" user@domain

In addition, the use of \-f is not restricted when testing a filter file with
\-bf or when testing or verifying addresses using the \-bt or \-bv
options.

Allowing untrusted users to change the sender address does not of itself make
it possible to send anonymous mail. Exim still checks that the From: header
refers to the local user, and if it does not, it adds a Sender: header,
though this can be overridden by setting "no_local_from_check".

White space between \-f and the <address> is optional
(that is, they can be given as two arguments or one combined argument).
The sender of a locally\-generated message can also be set (when permitted) by
an initial `From ' line in the message \-\- see the description of \-bm above
\-\- but if \-f is also present, it overrides `From'.
.TP
\fB\-G\fR
This is a Sendmail option which is ignored by Exim.
.TP
\fB\-h  <number>\fR
This option is accepted for compatibility with Sendmail, but has no effect. (In
Sendmail it overrides the `hop count' obtained by counting Received:
headers.)
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
This option, which has the same effect as \-oi, specifies that a dot on a
line by itself should not terminate an incoming, non\-SMTP message. I can find
no documentation for this option in Solaris 2.4 Sendmail, but the mailx
command in Solaris 2.4 uses it. See also \-ti.
.TP
\fB\-M  <message id> <message id> ...\fR
This option requests Exim to run a delivery attempt on each message in turn. If
any of the messages are frozen, they are automatically thawed before the
delivery attempt. The settings of "queue_domains", "queue_smtp_domains", and
"hold_domains" are ignored.
Retry hints for any of the addresses are
overridden \-\- Exim tries to deliver even if the normal retry time has not yet
been reached. This option requires the caller to be an admin user. However,
there is an option called "prod_requires_admin" which can be set false to
relax this restriction (and also the same requirement for the \-q, \-R, and
\-S options).
.TP
\fB\-Mar  <message id> <address> <address> ...\fR
This option requests Exim to add the addresses to the list of recipients of the
message (`ar' for `add recipients'). The first argument must be a message id,
and the remaining ones must be email addresses. However, if the message is
active (in the middle of a delivery attempt), it is not altered. This option
can be used only by an admin user.
.TP
\fB\-MC  <transport> <hostname> <sequence number> <message id>\fR
This option is not intended for use by external callers. It is used internally
by Exim to invoke another instance of itself to deliver a waiting message using
an existing SMTP connection, which is passed as the standard input. This must be the final option, and the caller must
be root or the Exim user in order to use it.
.TP
\fB\-MCA\fR
This option is not intended for use by external callers. It is used internally
by Exim in conjunction with the \-MC option. It signifies that the connection
to the remote host has been authenticated.
.TP
\fB\-MCP\fR
This option is not intended for use by external callers. It is used internally
by Exim in conjunction with the \-MC option. It signifies that the server to
which Exim is connected supports pipelining.
.TP
\fB\-MCQ  <process id> <pipe fd>\fR
This option is not intended for use by external callers. It is used internally
by Exim in conjunction with the \-MC option when the original delivery was
started by a queue runner. It passes on the process id of the queue runner,
together with the file descriptor number of an open pipe. Closure of the pipe
signals the final completion of the sequence of processes that are passing
messages through the same SMTP connection.
.TP
\fB\-MCS\fR
This option is not intended for use by external callers. It is used internally
by Exim in conjunction with the \-MC option, and passes on the fact that the
SMTP SIZE option should be used on messages delivered down the existing
connection.
.TP
\fB\-MCT\fR
This option is not intended for use by external callers. It is used internally
by Exim in conjunction with the \-MC option, and passes on the fact that the
host to which Exim is connected supports TLS encryption.
.TP
\fB\-Mc  <message id> <message id> ...\fR
This option requests Exim to run a delivery attempt on each message in turn,
but unlike the \-M option, it does check for retry hints, and respects any
that are found. This option is not very useful to external callers. It is
provided mainly for internal use by Exim when it needs to re\-invoke itself in
order to regain root privilege for a delivery.
However, \-Mc can be useful when testing, in order to run a delivery that
respects retry times and other options such as "hold_domains" that are
overridden when \-M is used. Such a delivery does not count as a queue run.
If you want to run a specific delivery as if in a queue run, you should use
\-q with a message id argument. A distinction between queue run deliveries
and other deliveries is made in one or two places.
.TP
\fB\-Mes  <message id> <address>\fR
This option requests Exim to change the sender address in the message to the
given address, which must be a fully qualified address or `<>' (`es' for `edit
sender'). There must be exactly two arguments. The first argument must be a
message id, and the second one an email address. However, if the message is
active (in the middle of a delivery attempt), its status is not altered. This
option can be used only by an admin user.
.TP
\fB\-Mf  <message id> <message id> ...\fR
This option requests Exim to mark each listed message as `frozen'. This
prevents any delivery attempts taking place until the message is `thawed',
either manually or as a result of the "auto_thaw" configuration option.
However, if any of the messages are active (in the middle of a delivery
attempt), their status is not altered. This option can be used only by an admin
user.
.TP
\fB\-Mg  <message id> <message id> ...\fR
This option requests Exim to give up trying to deliver the listed messages,
including any that are frozen. However, if any of the messages are active,
their status is not altered.
For non\-bounce messages, a delivery error message is sent to the sender,
containing the text `cancelled by administrator'. Bounce messages are just
discarded.
This option can be used only by an admin user.
.TP
\fB\-Mmad  <message id> <message id> ...\fR
This option requests Exim to mark all the recipient addresses in the messages
as already delivered (`mad' for `mark all delivered'). However, if any message
is active (in the middle of a delivery attempt), its status is not altered.
This option can be used only by an admin user.
.TP
\fB\-Mmd  <message id> <address> <address> ...\fR
This option requests Exim to mark the given addresses as already delivered
(`md' for `mark delivered'). The first argument must be a message id, and the
remaining ones must be email addresses. These are matched to recipient
addresses in the message in a case\-sensitive manner. If the message is active
(in the middle of a delivery attempt), its status is not altered. This option
can be used only by an admin user.
.TP
\fB\-Mrm  <message id> <message id> ...\fR
This option requests Exim to remove the given messages from the queue. No
bounce messages are sent; each message is simply forgotten. However, if any of
the messages are active, their status is not altered. This option can be used
only by an admin user or by the user who originally caused the message to be
placed on the queue.
.TP
\fB\-Mt  <message id> <message id> ...\fR
This option requests Exim to `thaw' any of the listed messages that are
`frozen', so that delivery attempts can resume. However, if any of the messages
are active, their status is not altered. This option can be used only by an
admin user.
.TP
\fB\-Mvb  <message id>\fR
This option causes the contents of the message body (\-D) spool file to be
written to the standard output. This option can be used only by an admin user.
.TP
\fB\-Mvh  <message id>\fR
This option causes the contents of the message headers (\-H) spool file to be
written to the standard output. This option can be used only by an admin user.
.TP
\fB\-Mvl  <message id>\fR
This option causes the contents of the message log spool file to be written to
the standard output. This option can be used only by an admin user.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR
This is apparently a synonym for \-om that is accepted by Sendmail, so Exim
treats it that way too.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR
This is a debugging option that inhibits delivery of a message at the transport
level. It implies \-v. Exim goes through many of the motions of delivery \-\-
it just doesn't actually transport the message, but instead behaves as if it
had successfully done so. However, it does not make any updates to the retry
database, and the log entries for deliveries are flagged with `*>' rather
than `=>'.

Because \-N discards any message to which it applies, only root or the Exim
user are allowed to use it with \-bd, \-q, \-R or \-M. In other words,
an ordinary user can use it only when supplying an incoming message to which it
will apply. Although transportation never fails when \-N is set, an address
may be deferred because of a configuration problem on a transport, or a routing
problem. Once \-N has been used for a delivery attempt, it sticks to the
message, and applies to any subsequent delivery attempts that may happen for
that message.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR
This option is interpreted by Sendmail to mean `no aliasing'. It is ignored by
Exim.
.TP
\fB\-O  <data>\fR
This option is interpreted by Sendmail to mean `set option`. It is ignored by
Exim.
.TP
\fB\-oA  <file name>\fR
This option is used by Sendmail in conjunction with \-bi to specify an
alternative alias file name. Exim handles \-bi differently; see the
description above.
.TP
\fB\-oB  <n>\fR
This is a debugging option which limits the maximum number of messages that can
be delivered down one SMTP connection, overriding the value set in any "smtp"
transport. If <n> is omitted, the limit is set to 1.
.TP
\fB\-odb\fR
This option applies to all modes in which Exim accepts incoming messages,
including the listening daemon. It requests `background' delivery of such
messages, which means that the accepting process automatically starts delivery
process for each message received, but does not wait for the delivery process
to complete. This is the default action if none of the \-od options are
present.

If one of the queueing options in the configuration file
("queue_only" or "queue_only_file", for example) is in effect, \-odb
overrides it if "queue_only_override" is set true, which is the default
setting. If "queue_only_override" is set false, \-odb has no effect.
.TP
\fB\-odf\fR
This option requests `foreground' (synchronous) delivery when Exim has accepted
a locally\-generated message. (For the daemon it is exactly the same as
\-odb.) A delivery process is automatically started to deliver the
message, and Exim waits for it to complete before proceeding.
However, like \-odb, this option has no effect if "queue_only_override" is
false and one of the queueing options in the configuration file is in effect.
.TP
\fB\-odi\fR
This option is synonymous with \-odf. It is provided for compatibility with
Sendmail.
.TP
\fB\-odq\fR
This option applies to all modes in which Exim accepts incoming messages,
including the listening daemon. It specifies that the accepting process should
not automatically start a delivery process for each message received. Messages
are placed on the queue, and remain there until a subsequent queue runner
process encounters them.
There are several configuration options (such as "queue_only") that can be
used to queue incoming messages under certain conditions. This option overrides
all of them and also \-odqs. It always forces queueing.
.TP
\fB\-odqs\fR
This option is a hybrid between \-odb/\-odi and \-odq.
However, like \-odb and \-odi, this option has no effect if
"queue_only_override" is false and one of the queueing options in the
configuration file is in effect.

When \-odqs does operate, a delivery process is started for each incoming
message, in the background by default, but in the foreground if \-odi is also
present.
The recipient addresses are routed, and local deliveries are done in the normal
way. However, if any SMTP deliveries are required, they are not done at this
time, so the message remains on the queue until a subsequent queue runner
process encounters it. Because routing was done, Exim knows which messages are
waiting for which hosts, and so a number of messages for the same host can be
sent in a single SMTP connection. The "queue_smtp_domains" configuration
option has the same effect for specific domains. See also the \-qq option.
.TP
\fB\-oee\fR
If an error is detected while a non\-SMTP message is being received (for
example, a malformed address), the error is reported to the sender in a mail
message.
Provided this error message is successfully sent, the Exim receiving process
exits with a return code of zero. If not, the return code is 2 if the problem
is that the original message has no recipients, or 1 any other error. This is
the default \-oex option if Exim is called as rmail.
.TP
\fB\-oem\fR
This is the same as \-oee, except that Exim always exits with a non\-zero
return code, whether or not the error message was successfully sent.
This is the default \-oex option, unless Exim is called as rmail.
.TP
\fB\-oep\fR
If an error is detected while a non\-SMTP message is being received, the
error is reported by writing a message to the standard error file (stderr).
The return code is 1 for all errors.
.TP
\fB\-oeq\fR
This option is supported for compatibility with Sendmail, but has the same
effect as \-oep.
.TP
\fB\-oew\fR
This option is supported for compatibility with Sendmail, but has the same
effect as \-oem.
.TP
\fB\-oi\fR
This option, which has the same effect as \-i, specifies that a dot on a line
by itself should not terminate an incoming, non\-SMTP message.
Otherwise, a single dot does terminate, though Exim does no special processing
for other lines that start with a dot.
This option is set by default if Exim is called as rmail. See also \-ti.
.TP
\fB\-oitrue\fR
This option is treated as synonymous with \-oi.
.TP
\fB\-oMa  <host address>\fR
A number of options starting with \-oM can be used to set values associated
with remote hosts on locally\-submitted messages (that is, messages not received
over TCP/IP). These options can be used by any caller in conjunction with the
\-bh,
\-be,
\-bf, \-bF, \-bt, or \-bv testing options. In other circumstances, they
are ignored unless the caller is trusted.

The \-oMa option sets the sender host address. This may include a port number
at the end, after a full stop (period). For example:

  exim \-bs \-oMa 10.9.8.7.1234

An alternative syntax is to enclose the IP address in square brackets, followed
by a colon and the port number:

  exim \-bs \-oMa [10.9.8.7]:1234

The IP address is placed in the $sender_host_address variable, and the
port, if present, in $sender_host_port.
.TP
\fB\-oMaa  <name>\fR
See \-oMa above for general remarks about the \-oM options. The \-oMaa
option sets the value of $sender_host_authenticated (the authenticator
name).
.TP
\fB\-oMai  <string>\fR
See \-oMa above for general remarks about the \-oM options. The \-oMai
option sets the
value of $authenticated_id (the id that was authenticated).
This overrides the default value (the caller's login id) for messages from
local sources.
.TP
\fB\-oMas  <address>\fR
See \-oMa above for general remarks about the \-oM options. The \-oMas
option sets the authenticated sender value
in $authenticated_sender.
It overrides the sender address that is created from the caller's login id for
messages from local sources.
.TP
\fB\-oMi  <interface address>\fR
See \-oMa above for general remarks about the \-oM options. The \-oMi
option sets the IP interface address value. A port number may be included,
using the same syntax as for \-oMa.
The interface address is placed in $interface_address and the port number,
if present, in $interface_port.
.TP
\fB\-oMr  <protocol name>\fR
See \-oMa above for general remarks about the \-oM options. The \-oMr
option sets the received protocol value
in $received_protocol.
However, this applies only when \-bs is not used. For interactive SMTP input,
the protocol is determined by whether EHLO or HELO is used, and is
always either `local\-esmtp' or `local\-smtp'. For \-bS (batch SMTP) however,
the protocol can be set by \-oMr.
.TP
\fB\-oMs  <host name>\fR
See \-oMa above for general remarks about the \-oM options. The \-oMs
option sets the sender host name
in $sender_host_name. When this option is present, Exim does not attempt
to look up a host name from an IP address; it uses the name it is given.
.TP
\fB\-oMt  <ident string>\fR
See \-oMa above for general remarks about the \-oM options. The \-oMt
option sets the sender ident value
in $sender_ident.
The default setting for local callers is the login id of the calling process.
.TP
\fB\-om\fR
In Sendmail, this option means `me too', indicating that the sender of a
message should receive a copy of the message if the sender appears in an alias
expansion. Exim always does this, so the option does nothing.
.TP
\fB\-oo\fR
This option is ignored. In Sendmail it specifies `old style headers', whatever
that means.
.TP
\fB\-oP  <path>\fR
This option is useful only in conjunction with \-bd or \-q with a time
value. The option specifies the file to which the process id of the daemon is
written. When \-oX is used with \-bd, or when \-q with a time is used
without \-bd, this is the only way of causing Exim to write a pid file,
because in those cases, the normal pid file is not used.
.TP
\fB\-or  <time>\fR
This option sets a timeout value for incoming non\-SMTP messages. If it is not
set, Exim will wait forever for the standard input. The value can also be set
by the "receive_timeout" option.
.TP
\fB\-os  <time>\fR
This option sets a timeout value for incoming SMTP messages. The timeout
applies to each SMTP command and block of data. The value can also be set by
the "smtp_receive_timeout" option; it defaults to 5 minutes.
.TP
\fB\-ov\fR
This option has exactly the same effect as \-v.
.TP
\fB\-oX  <number or string>\fR
This option is relevant only when the \-bd (start listening daemon) option is
also given. It controls which ports and interfaces the daemon uses. When \-oX is used to start a daemon, no pid file is
written unless \-oP is also present to specify a pid file name.
.TP
\fB\-pd\fR
This option applies when an embedded Perl interpreter is linked with Exim. It overrides the setting of the "perl_at_start" option,
forcing the starting of the interpreter to be delayed until it is needed.
.TP
\fB\-ps\fR
This option applies when an embedded Perl interpreter is linked with Exim. It overrides the setting of the "perl_at_start" option,
forcing the starting of the interpreter to occur as soon as Exim is started.
.TP
\fB\-p<rval>:<sval>\fR
For compatibility with Sendmail, this option
is equivalent to

  \-oMr <rval> \-oMs <sval>

It sets the incoming protocol and host name (for trusted callers). The
host name and its colon can be omitted when only the protocol is to be set.
Note the Exim already has two private options, \-pd and \-ps, that refer to
embedded Perl. It is therefore impossible to set a protocol value of p or
s using this option (but that does not seem a real limitation).
.TP
\fB\-q\fR
This option is normally restricted to admin users. However, there is a
configuration option called "prod_requires_admin" which can be set false to
relax this restriction (and also the same requirement for the \-M, \-R, and
\-S options).

The \-q option starts one queue runner process. This scans the queue of
waiting messages, and runs a delivery process for each one in turn. It waits
for each delivery process to finish before starting the next one. A delivery
process may not actually do any deliveries if the retry times for the addresses
have not been reached. Use \-qf (see below) if you want to override this.
If the delivery process spawns other processes to deliver other messages down
passed SMTP connections, the queue runner waits for these to finish before
proceeding.

When all the queued messages have been considered, the original queue runner
process terminates. In other words, a single pass is made over the waiting
mail, one message at a time. Use \-q with a time (see below) if you want this
to be repeated periodically.

Exim processes the waiting messages in an unpredictable order. It isn't very
random, but it is likely to be different each time, which is all that matters.
If one particular message screws up a remote MTA, other messages to the same
MTA have a chance of getting through if they get tried first.

It is possible to cause the messages to be processed in lexical message id
order, which is essentially the order in which they arrived, by setting the
"queue_run_in_order" option, but this is not recommended for normal use.
.TP
\fB\-q <qflags>\fR
The \-q option may be followed by one or more flag letters that change its
behaviour. They are all optional, but if more than one is present, they must
appear in the correct order. Each flag is described in a separate item below.
.TP
\fB\-qq...\fR
An option starting with \-qq requests a two\-stage queue run. In the first
stage, the queue is scanned as if the "queue_smtp_domains" option matched
every domain. Addresses are routed, local deliveries happen, but no remote
transports are run.
The hints database that remembers which messages are
waiting for specific hosts is updated, as if delivery to those hosts had been
deferred. After this is complete, a second, normal queue scan happens, with
routing and delivery taking place as normal. Messages that are routed to the
same host should mostly be delivered down a single SMTP
connection because of the hints that were set up during the first queue scan.
This option may be useful for hosts that are connected to the Internet
intermittently.
.TP
\fB\-q[q]i...\fR
If the i flag is present, the queue runner runs delivery processes only for
those messages that haven't previously been tried. (i stands for `initial
delivery'.) This can be helpful if you are putting messages on the queue using
\-odq and want a queue runner just to process the new messages.
.TP
\fB\-q[q][i]f...\fR
If one f flag is present, a delivery attempt is forced for each non\-frozen
message, whereas without "f" only those non\-frozen addresses that have passed
their retry times are tried.
.TP
\fB\-q[q][i]ff...\fR
If ff is present, a delivery attempt is forced for every message, whether
frozen or not.
.TP
\fB\-q[q][i][f[f]]l\fR
The l (the letter `ell') flag specifies that only local deliveries are to be
done. If a message requires any remote deliveries, it remains on the queue for
later delivery.
.TP
\fB\-q <qflags> <start id> <end id>\fR
When scanning the queue, Exim can be made to skip over messages whose ids are
lexically less than a given value by following the \-q option with a starting
message id. For example:

  exim \-q 0t5C6f\-0000c8\-00

Messages that arrived earlier than 0t5C6f\-0000c8\-00 are not inspected. If a
second message id is given, messages whose ids are lexically greater than it
are also skipped. If the same id is given twice, for example,

  exim \-q 0t5C6f\-0000c8\-00 0t5C6f\-0000c8\-00

just one delivery process is started, for that message. This differs from \-M
in that retry data is respected, and it also differs from \-Mc in that it
counts as a delivery from a queue run. Note that the selection mechanism does
not affect the order in which the messages are scanned. There are also other
ways of selecting specific sets of messages for delivery in a queue run \-\- see
\-R and \-S.
.TP
\fB\-q <qflags><time>\fR
When a time value is present, the \-q option causes Exim to run as a daemon,
starting a queue runner process at intervals specified by the given time value. This form of the \-q
option is commonly combined with the \-bd option, in which case a single
daemon process handles both functions. A common way of starting up a combined
daemon at system boot time is to use a command such as

  /usr/exim/bin/exim \-bd \-q30m

Such a daemon listens for incoming SMTP calls, and also starts a queue runner
process every 30 minutes.

When a daemon is started by \-q with a time value, but without \-bd, no pid
file is written unless one is explicitly requested by the \-oP option.
.TP
\fB\-qR <rsflags> <string>\fR
This option is synonymous with \-R. It is provided for Sendmail
compatibility.
.TP
\fB\-qS <rsflags> <string>\fR
This option is synonymous with \-S.
.TP
\fB\-R <rsflags> <string>\fR
The <rsflags> may be empty, in which case the white space before the string
is optional, unless the string is f, ff, r, rf, or rff,
which are the possible values for <rsflags>. White space is required if
<rsflags> is not empty.

This option is similar to \-q with no time value, that is, it causes Exim to
perform a single queue run, except that, when scanning the messages on the
queue, Exim processes only those that have at least one undelivered recipient
address containing the given string, which is checked in a case\-independent
way. If the <rsflags> start with r, <string> is interpreted as a regular
expression; otherwise it is a literal string.

Once a message is selected, all its addresses are processed. For the first
selected message, Exim overrides any retry information and forces a delivery
attempt for each undelivered address. This means that if delivery of any
address in the first message is successful, any existing retry information is
deleted, and so delivery attempts for that address in subsequently selected
messages (which are processed without forcing) will run. However, if delivery
of any address does not succeed, the retry information is updated, and in
subsequently selected messages, the failing address will be skipped.

If the <rsflags> contain f or ff, the delivery forcing applies to all
selected messages, not just the first;
frozen messages are included when ff is present.

The \-R option makes it straightforward to initiate delivery of all messages
to a given domain after a host has been down for some time. When the SMTP
command ETRN is accepted by its ACL, its default
effect is to run Exim with the \-R option, but it can be configured to run an
arbitrary command instead.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR
This is a documented (for Sendmail) obsolete alternative name for \-f.
.TP
\fB\-S <rsflags> <string>\fR
This option acts like \-R except that it checks the string against each
message's sender instead of against the recipients. If \-R is also set, both
conditions must be met for a message to be selected. If either of the options
has f or ff in its flags, the associated action is taken.
.TP
\fB\-Tqt <times>\fR
This an option that is exclusively for use by the Exim testing suite.
It is not recognized when Exim is run normally. It allows for the setting up
of explicit `queue times' so that various warning/retry features can be
tested.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR
When Exim is receiving a locally\-generated, non\-SMTP message on its standard
input, the \-t option causes the recipients of the message to be obtained
from the To:, Cc:, and Bcc: header lines in the message instead of from
the command arguments. The addresses are extracted before any rewriting takes
place.

If the command has any arguments, they specify addresses to which the message
is not to be delivered. That is, the argument addresses are removed from
the recipients list obtained from the headers. This is compatible with Smail 3
and in accordance with the documented behaviour of several versions of
Sendmail, as described in man pages on a number of operating systems (e.g.
Solaris 8, IRIX 6.5, HP\-UX 11). However, some versions of Sendmail add
argument addresses to those obtained from the headers, and the O'Reilly
Sendmail book documents it that way. Exim can be made to add argument addresses
instead of subtracting them by setting the option
"extract_addresses_remove_arguments" false.

If a Bcc: header line is present, it is removed from the message unless
there is no To: or Cc:, in which case a Bcc: line with no data is
created. This is necessary for conformity with the original RFC 822 standard;
the requirement has been removed in RFC 2822, but that is still very new.

If there are any "Resent\-" header lines in the message, Exim extracts
recipients from all Resent\-To:, Resent\-Cc:, and Resent\-Bcc: header
lines instead of from To:, Cc:, and Bcc:. This is for compatibility
with Sendmail and other MTAs. (Prior to release 4.20, Exim gave an error if
\-t was used in conjunction with "Resent\-" header lines.)

RFC 2822 talks about different sets of "Resent\-" header lines (for when a
message is resent several times). The RFC also specifies that they should be
added at the front of the message, and separated by Received: lines. It is
not at all clear how \-t should operate in the present of multiple sets,
nor indeed exactly what constitutes a `set'.
In practice, it seems that MUAs do not follow the RFC. The "Resent\-" lines are
often added at the end of the header, and if a message is resent more than
once, it is common for the original set of "Resent\-" headers to be renamed as
"X\-Resent\-" when a new set is added. This removes any possible ambiguity.
.TP
\fB\-ti\fR
This option is exactly equivalent to \-t \-i. It is provided for
compatibility with Sendmail.
.TP
\fB\-tls\-on\-connect\fR
This option is available when Exim is compiled with TLS support. It makes it
possible to support legacy clients that do not support the STARTTLS
command, but instead expect to start up a TLS session as soon as a connection
to the server is established. These clients use a special port (usually called
the `ssmtp' port) instead of the normal SMTP port 25. The \-tls\-on\-connect
option can be used to run Exim in this way from inetd, and it can also be
used to run a special daemon that operates in this manner (use \-oX to
specify the port). However, although it is possible to run one daemon that
listens on several ports, it is not possible to have some of them operate one
way and some the other. With only a few clients that need the legacy support, a
convenient approach is to use a daemon for normal SMTP (with or without
STARTTLS) and inetd with \-tls\-on\-connect for the legacy clients.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR
Sendmail uses this option for `initial message submission', and its
documentation states that in future releases, it may complain about
syntactically invalid messages rather than fixing them when this flag is not
set. Exim ignores this option.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
This option causes Exim to write information to the standard error stream,
describing what it is doing. In particular, it shows the log lines for
receiving and delivering a message, and if an SMTP connection is made, the SMTP
dialogue is shown. Some of the log lines shown may not actually be written to
the log if the setting of "log_selector" discards them. Any relevant selectors
are shown with each log line. If none are shown, the logging is unconditional.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
AIX uses \-x for a private purpose (`mail from a local mail program has
National Language Support extended characters in the body of the mail item').
It sets \-x when calling the MTA from its "mail" command. Exim ignores this
option.
