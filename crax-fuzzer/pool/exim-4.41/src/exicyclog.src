# This is a shell script for cycling exim main and reject log files. Each time
# it is run, the files get "shuffled down" by one, the current one (e.g.
# mainlog) becoming mainlog.01, the previous mainlog.01 becoming mainlog.02,
# and so on, up to the limit configured here. The same happens to the reject
# logs. All those with numbers greater than 1 are compressed.

# This script should be called regularly (e.g. daily) by a root crontab
# entry of the form

# The following lines are generated from Exim's configuration file when
# this source is built into a script, but you can subsequently edit them
# without rebuilding things, as long are you are careful not to overwrite
# the script in the next Exim rebuild/install. "Keep" is the number of old log
# files that are required to be kept. "Compress" and "suffix" define your
# chosen compression method. The others are provided because the location
# of certain commands varies from OS to OS. Sigh.
