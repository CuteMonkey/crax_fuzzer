*            Write message to log file           *
*************************************************/

/* Exim can be configured to log to local files, or use syslog, or both. This
is controlled by the setting of log_file_path. The following cases are
recognized:

  log_file_path = ""               write files in the spool/log directory
  log_file_path = "xxx"            write files in the xxx directory
  log_file_path = "syslog"         write to syslog
  log_file_path = "syslog : xxx"   write to syslog and to files (any order)

The one exception to this is messages containing LOG_PROCESS. These are always
written to exim-process.info in the spool directory. They aren't really log
messages in the same sense as the others.

The message always gets '\n' added on the end of it, since more than one
process may be writing to the log at once and we don't want intermingling to
happen in the middle of lines. To be absolutely sure of this we write the data
into a private buffer and then put it out in a single write() call.

The flags determine which log(s) the message is written to, or for syslogging,
which priority to use, and in the case of the panic log, whether the process
should die afterwards.

The variable really_exim is TRUE only when exim is running in privileged state
(i.e. not with a changed configuration or with testing options such as -brw).
If it is not, don't try to write to the log because permission will probably be
denied.

Avoid actually writing to the logs when exim is called with -bv or -bt to
test an address, but take other actions, such as panicing.

In Exim proper, the buffer for building the message is got at start-up, so that
nothing gets done if it can't be got. However, some functions that are also
used in utilities occasionally obey log_write calls in error situations, and it
is simplest to put a single malloc() here rather than put one in each utility.
Malloc is used directly because the store functions may call log_write().

If a message_id exists, we include it after the timestamp.

Arguments:
  selector  write to main log or LOG_INFO only if this value is zero, or if
              its bit is set in log_write_selector
  flags     each bit indicates some independent action:
              LOG_SENDER      add raw sender to the message
              LOG_RECIPIENTS  add raw recipients list to message
              LOG_CONFIG      add "Exim configuration error"
              LOG_CONFIG_FOR  add " for " instead of ":\n  "
              LOG_CONFIG_IN   add " in line x[ of file y]"
              LOG_MAIN        write to main log or syslog LOG_INFO
              LOG_REJECT      write to reject log or syslog LOG_NOTICE
              LOG_PANIC       write to panic log or syslog LOG_ALERT
              LOG_PANIC_DIE   write to panic log or LOG_ALERT and then crash
              LOG_PROCESS     write to process log (always a file)
