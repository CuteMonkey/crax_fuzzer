/* When reading SMTP from a remote host, we have to use our own versions of the
C input-reading functions, in order to be able to flush the SMTP output only
when about to read more data from the socket. This is the only way to get
optimal performance when the client is using pipelining. Flushing for every
command causes a separate packet and reply packet each time; saving all the
responses up (when pipelining) combines them into one packet and one response.

For simplicity, these functions are used for *all* SMTP input, not only when
receiving over a socket. However, after setting up a secure socket (SSL), input
is read via the OpenSSL library, and another set of functions is used instead
(see tls.c).

These functions are set in the receive_getc etc. variables and called with the
same interface as the C functions. However, since there can only ever be
one incoming SMTP call, we just use a single buffer and flags. There is no need
to implement a complicated private FILE-like structure.*/

  Linux (and others now, see below) is different to everyone else, so there
  has to be some conditional compilation here. Versions of Linux before 2.1.15
  used a structure whose name was "options". Somebody finally realized that
  this name was silly, and it got changed to "ip_options". I use the
  newer name here, but there is a fudge in the script that sets up os.h
  to define a macro in older Linux systems.

  Sigh. Linux is a fast-moving target. Another generation of Linux uses
  glibc 2, which has chosen ip_opts for the structure name. This is now
  really a glibc thing rather than a Linux thing, so the condition name
  has been changed to reflect this. It is relevant also to GNU/Hurd.

  Mac OS 10.x (Darwin) is like the later glibc versions, but without the
  setting of the __GLIBC__ macro, so we can't detect it automatically. There's
  a special macro defined in the os.h file.

  Some DGUX versions on older hardware appear not to support IP options at
  all, so there is now a general macro which can be set to cut out this
  support altogether.

  How to do this properly in IPv6 is not yet known. */
