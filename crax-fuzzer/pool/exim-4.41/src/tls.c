/* This module provides TLS (aka SSL) support for Exim. The code for OpenSSL is
based on a patch that was originally contributed by Steve Haslam. It was
adapted from stunnel, a GPL program by Michal Trojnara. The code for GNU TLS is
based on a patch contributed by Nikos Mavroyanopoulos. Because these packages
are so very different, the functions for each are kept in separate files. The
relevant file is #included as required, after any any common functions.

No cryptographic code is included in Exim. All this module does is to call
functions from the OpenSSL or GNU TLS libraries. */

modules, so keep them happy with a dummy when skipping the rest. Make it
reference itself to stop picky compilers complaining that it is unused, and put
in a dummy argument to stop even pickier compilers complaining about infinite
loops. */
