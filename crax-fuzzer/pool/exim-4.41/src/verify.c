                      change sender_address

                      rewriting and messages from callouts
                    vopt_qualify => qualify an unqualified address; else error

                    These ones are used by do_callout() -- the options variable

                    vopt_callout_postmaster => do postmaster check

                    vopt_callout_recipsender => use real sender for recipient
                    vopt_callout_recippmaster => use postmaster for recipient

  routed          if not NULL, set TRUE if routing succeeded, so we can

/*************************************************
*    Check a specific host matches a host list   *
*************************************************/

/* This function is passed a host list containing items in a number of
different formats and the identity of a host. Its job is to determine whether
the given host is in the set of hosts defined by the list. The host name is
passed as a pointer so that it can be looked up if needed and not already
known. This is commonly the case when called from verify_check_host() to check
an incoming connection. When called from elsewhere the host name should usually
be set.

This function is now just a front end to match_check_list(), which runs common
code for scanning a list. We pass it the check_host() function to perform a
single test.

Arguments:
  listptr              pointer to the host list
  cache_bits           pointer to cache for named lists, or NULL
  host_name            the host name or NULL, implying use sender_host_name and
                         sender_host_aliases, looking them up if required
  host_address         the IP address
  valueptr             if not NULL, data from a lookup is passed back here

Returns:    OK    if the host is in the defined set
            FAIL  if the host is not in the defined set,
            DEFER if a data lookup deferred (not a host lookup)

If the host name was needed in order to make a comparison, and could not be
determined from the IP address, the result is FAIL unless the item
"+allow_unknown" was met earlier in the list, in which case OK is returned. */

/*************************************************
*        Check host against DNS black lists      *
*************************************************/

/* This function runs checks against a list of DNS black lists, until one
matches. Each item on the list can be of the form

  domain=ip-address/key

The domain is the right-most domain that is used for the query, for example,
blackholes.mail-abuse.org. If the IP address is present, there is a match only
if the DNS lookup returns a matching IP address. Several addresses may be
given, comma-separated, for example: x.y.z=127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2.

If no key is given, what is looked up in the domain is the inverted IP address
of the current client host. If a key is given, it is used to construct the
domain for the lookup. For example,

  dsn.rfc-ignorant.org/$sender_address_domain

After finding a match in the DNS, the domain is placed in $dnslist_domain, and
then we check for a TXT record for an error message, and if found, save its
value in $dnslist_text. We also cache everything in a tree, to optimize
multiple lookups.

Note: an address for testing RBL is 192.203.178.39
Note: an address for testing DUL is 192.203.178.4
Note: a domain for testing RFCI is example.tld.dsn.rfc-ignorant.org

Arguments:
  listptr      the domain/address/data list

Returns:    OK      successful lookup (i.e. the address is on the list), or
                      lookup deferred after +include_unknown
