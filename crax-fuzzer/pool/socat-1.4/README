socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two independent data
channels. Each of these data channels may be a file, pipe, device (serial line
etc. or a pseudo terminal), a socket (UNIX, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP, TCP), an
SSL socket, proxy CONNECT connection, a file descriptor (stdin etc.), the GNU
line editor (readline), a program, or a combination of two of these. 
These modes include generation of "listening" sockets, mamed pipes, and pseudo
terminals.

socat can be used, e.g., as TCP port forwarder (one-shot or daemon), as an
external socksifier, for attacking weak firewalls, as a shell interface to UNIX
sockets, IP6 relay, for redirecting TCP oriented programs to a serial line, to
logically connect serial lines on different computers, or to establish a
relatively secure environment (su and  chroot) for running client or server
shell scripts with network connections. 

Many options are available to refine socats behaviour:
terminal parameters, open() options, file permissions, file and process owners,
basic socket options like bind address, advanced socket options like IP source
routing, linger, TTL, TOS (type of service), or TCP performance tuning.

More capabilities, like daemon mode with forking, client address check,
"tail -f" mode, some stream data processing (line terminator conversion),
choosing sockets, pipes, or ptys for interprocess communication, debug and
trace options, logging to syslog, stderr or file, and last but not least
precise error messages make it a versatile tool for many different purposes.

In fact, many of these features already exist in specialized tools; but until
now, there does not seem to exists another tool that provides such a generic,
flexible, simple and almost comprehensive (UNIX) byte stream connector.


packages
--------

before bothering with compilers, dependencies and include files, you might
try to get a binary distribution that matches your platform. Have a look at 
the projects home page for actual information regarding socat binary 
distributions.

Binary packages with socat version 1.2 have been available for:

RedHat Linux 7.2 / X86
SuSE Linux 7.3 /X86
FreeBSD 4.6
Debian Linux (unstable)
OpenPKG
Zaurus


platforms
---------

socat 1.4.0 was compiled and more or less successfully tested under the
following operating systems:

SuSE Linux 8.2 on x86
RedHat Linux 9.0 on x86
AIX 5.1 on PPC with gcc 2.9
Solaris 9 on Sparc with gcc
MacOS X 10.2 on PPC
FreeBSD 4.10 BETA on x86
NetBSD 1.6.1 on x86
OpenBSD 3.4 on x86
HP-UX B 11.11 on PA-RISC with gcc
Tru64 5.1B on Alpha with gcc

Some versions of socat have been reported to successfully compile under older
Linux versions back to RedHat 2.1 (kernel 1.2.13, gcc 2.7.0), under AIX 4.1 
and 4.3, SunOS 5.7-5.8, FreeBSD 4.2 - 4.9, MacOS X 10.1, Cygwin, Solaris 8 on x86,
and OSR 5.0.6.

It might well compile and run under other UNIX like operating systems.


install
-------

Get the tarball and extract it:
	gtar xzvf socat.tar.gz
	cd socat-1.4
	./configure
	make depend
	make
	su
	make install	# installs socat, filan, and procan in /usr/local/bin

For compiling socat, gcc (or egc) is recommended.
If gcc is not available, the configure script will fail to determine
some features; then you'd better begin with one of the Makefiles and config.h's
from the Config directory.

If you have problems with the OpenSSL library, you can apply the option
"--disable-openssl" to configure.

If you have problems with the readline library or (n)curses, you can apply the
option "--disable-readline" to configure.

If you have problems with the tcp wrappers library, you can apply the option
"--disable-libwrap" to configure.

If you still get errors or a tremendous amount of warnings you can exclude 
the features for system call tracing and file descriptor analyzing by
applying the options "--disable-sycls --disable-filan" to configure.

You still need the functions vsnprintf and snprintf that are in the GNU libc,
but might not be available with some proprietary libc's.

The configure script looks for headers and libraries of openssl, readline, and
tcp wrappers in the OS'es standard places and in the subdirectories include/
and lib/ of the following places: 
   /sw/
   /usr/local/
   /opt/freeware/
   /usr/sfw/
and for openssl also in:
   /usr/local/ssl/
In case of unexpected behaviour it is important to understand that configure
first searches for the appropriate include file and then expects to find the
library in the associated lib directory. That means, when e.g. a OpenSSL
installation resides under /usr/local and there is a symbolic link from
/usr/include/ssl/ssl.h to /usr/local/ssl/include/ssl/ssl.h, configure will find
the /usr/include/... header and will therefore expect libssl in /usr/lib
instead of /usr/local/...

If configure does not find a header file or library but you know where it is,
you can specify additional search locations, e.g.:
   export LIBS="-L$HOME/lib"
   export CPPFLAGS="-I$HOME/include"
before running configure and make.

For other operating system, if socat does not compile without errors, refer to
the file PORTING.


platform specifics - redhat
---------------------------

On RedHat Linux 9.0, including openssl/ssl.h might fail due to problems with
the krb5-devel package. configure reacts with disabling openssl integration. 
To solve this issue, help cpp to find the krb5.h include file:
CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/kerberos/include" ./configure


platform specifics - aix
------------------------

When using the OpenSSL rpm provided by IBM, configure might need the 
environment variable setting:
LIBS="-L/opt/freeware/lib"

When using the OpenSSL bundle provided by IBM, egd needs to be installed too
to get enough entropy.

socat compiles not only with gcc, but also with xlc. Just adapt the Makefile:
replace gcc by /usr/vac/bin/xlc and remove gcc specific options 
"-Wall -Wno-parentheses".

When linking with the OpenSSL library provided by IBM, errors may occur:
ld: 0711-317 ERROR: Undefined symbol: .__umoddi3
In this case, you need to link with libgcc or compile libcrypt yourself using
xlc, or disable SSL (in config.h, undefine WITH_OPENSSL and recompile)

The score of test.sh can be improved by uncommenting MISCDELAY=1 in this
script.


platform specifics - solaris
----------------------------

If libreadline or libssl are in a directory not searched by the loader per
default, e.g. /opt/sfw/lib, you must add this directory to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
for running both configure and the socat executables, e.g.:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/sfw/lib

For some shell scripts, it is preferable to have /usr/xpg4/bin at a prominent
position in $PATH.


platform specifics - hp-ux
--------------------------

Using socats PTY feature on HP-UX (11.11 on PA-RISC) blocks the isatty()
function (./test.sh FAKEPTY) or the pty just fails to transfer data (./test.sh
EXECPTY). No clue why this happens, this behaviour of HP-UX is not documented
:-) As a workaround, the test and example configuration for this platfrom were
performed without pty, i.e. configure was invoked with --disable-pty.

Shutting down the write channel of a UNIX domain socket does not seem to
trigger an EOF on the other socket. This makes problems with the exec and
system address.

This OS provides the type "long long", but not the strtoll() function to read
data into a long long variable.


documentation
-------------

socat.1 is the man page, socat.html is the HTML based man page. It is actual,
but describes only the more useful options.

xio.help is an older, but more comprehensive description in text form; some
details are outdated, but it describes all address options.
